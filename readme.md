## Python lessons by Sergey Zobin <http://zobin.org>

### Tasks

1) We play as a mob: Evaluate which of the variants of a very simple algorithm for choosing the direction for a mob would more effectively prevent the player's figure from passing for task 1, solution 4;
2) Write your own algorithm for choosing the direction for the mob's figure and compare its effectiveness


### Simple solutions

- Solution 1: Move forwarg until wall and turn right
- Solution 2: Move forwarg until wall and turn left
- Solution 3: Move forwarg until wall and select random left or right turn
- Solution 4: Move along right wall
- Solution 5: Move along left wall
